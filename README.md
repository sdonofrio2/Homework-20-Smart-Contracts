# Homework-20-Smart-Contracts

In this repository I created a Solidity Joint Savings smart contract. 

I created functions for depositing and withdrawing money, as well as functions to return the contract balance, the last to withdraw, and last withdraw amount. 

After coding the contract, I deployed the contract in the JavaScript VM.

In the Execution_Results folder, I provided screenshots of a few sample transactions.
